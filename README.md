# Microsoft Edge's *Let's Surf*
An improvement to the game *Let's Surf* from ``edge://surf``

The game is created by Microsoft â€“ please see the **Credits** in the game menu for more information. The files in this repo are from Microsoft Edge; however, some of them have been modified so the game can function independently from Edge or for bug fixes.

## Play
Play the game online at https://seethathuman.github.io/surfchallenge/

### Features
- Bug fixes for controller and controller cheat support
- Invisibility mode (press the konami code on either keyboard or controller)
